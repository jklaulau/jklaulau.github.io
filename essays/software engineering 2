<h1>What does Software Engineering mean to me now?</h1>

I can now see the effectiveness of Software Engineering and having it as a potential career choice for myself. ICS 314 was a true journey. There were so much experience to take in a short semester than I thought was possible. Creating projects with groupmates and finish hackathons were my favorite experience. Learning JavaScript and HTML was slow, but also only a small part of truely what Software Engineering means.

Learning to communicate and work together on projects can be a challenge. In many times, I do not see eye to eye with my groupmates. The obstacle then was not the program, but the teamwork required to overcome problems in the code. As to be expected by group experiences ranged greatly between the different projects which had different people. My HACC 2019 group was amazing, and our willingness to work together was beyond a doubt. It was a fun experience overall. My Eateerez project was not quite enhancing. I take from this that I must learn to adapt with the people I will be working with and to be flexible and patient with anyone I work with.

After taking ICS 314 and finishing two projects, my interest in software engineering is ever so heightened. However, I did begin with disliking using JavaScript and functional programming. I never quite got used to using the new IDE IntelliJ. Then again, I do remember the struggles I had with programming, even in my favorite language, Java. Perhaps, the lesson here is that being a programmer or software engineer takes an immense amount of patience. Programming is a lifestyle and the more you live with it, the more amazing it becomes.
