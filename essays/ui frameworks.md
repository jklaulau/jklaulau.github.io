UI Frameworks are not only difficult, but a standard for today's expectations for websites. All popular websites constantly update and use the latest versions. This keeps them fresh and trendy. If we were to pull up an old website from the early 2000s, the differences are obvious. And those old websites are probably using raw HTML and CSS. To reduce the fusteration of using UI Frameworks, small companies most likely use software such as Adobe's Dreamworks.

With my experience of using Semantic UI was a challenging one. I have no prior experience in developing wesbsites. As much as it is an eye opener, I can understand some of the frustrations of HTML that are expressed by others on the internet. I find myself attempting to change one line of the code to only have the output be the same or be something completely not what I intended. However as difficult as it is, I do believe front-end development is just as important as back-end. Customers will only see part of the whole project.
