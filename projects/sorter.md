The Sorter is an applicaiton built entirely on Java with its libraries. The application will produce an array with each index assigned a number. For now, every index is assgined an unique number with no repeats. Then the application will sort the array one step at time at given frame rate. The purpose of this application is give a visual representation of how a sorting algorithm works. 

<h1>Why is this project here on Github.io</h1>
First, I wanted to a project that shows my understanding of programming in Java. Java is the first program language I've learned and have dedicated many hours in mastering object oriented programming. Secondly, I believe understanding algorithms is a key part of being a programmer. Efficiency is king and a better program is one that uses its resources effectively. I hope here, I can demonstrate my understanding of algorithms through Java.

<h1>Future plans with Sorter</h1>
Since I have taken ICS 311 Algorithms at UHM, I want to implement new sorting algorithms that Iâ€™ve learned into the Sorter. Also, I can make a new repo of this project. I have not created a repo with Java before so this can be great experience to bring my favorite language onto the Github platform.
